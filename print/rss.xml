        <description><![CDATA[A network graph showing 426 programming languages connected by 670 influence relations. Highly influential languages like Lisp, Smalltalk, C, Java, C++, Haskell and Python are shown as larger circles as compared to languages with less influence on others like PHP, Rust and Go. The influence relation data was retrieved from Wikidata in 2018. A great gift for programmers who are into digital art. • Also buy this artwork on wall prints, apparel, phone cases, and more.]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[This graph shows the connections of programmers based on searches performed on Google in March 2013. The graph consists of 561 nodes and 1311 edges. To be included a person&#8217;s search result page on Google needed to have knowledge graph information indicating the person being a programmer. / The creators of the top programming languages according to GitHub served as seed values for searches, i. e. Brendan Eich (JavaScript), Yukihiro Matsumoto (Ruby), James Gosling (Java), Guido van Rossum (Python), Stephen R. Bourne (Bourne shell), William Nelson Joy (C shell), Rasmus Lerdorf (PHP), Dennis Ritchie &#169;, Bjarne Stroustrup (C++), Larry Wall (Perl), and Brad Cox (Objective-C). / The graph print is available on posters and several other products on white or Rose Quartz backgrounds. • Also buy this artwork on wall prints, stickers, phone cases, and more.]]></description>
