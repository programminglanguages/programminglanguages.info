Component Pascal was originally designed and supported by a small ETH Zürich spin-off company called Oberon microsystems under the name Oberon/L. They developed an IDE called BlackBox Component Builder. Since 2014 development and support has been taken over by a small group of volunteers. At the time the first version of the IDE was released it presented a novel approach to graphical user interface (GUI) construction based on editable forms, where fields and command buttons are linked to exported variables and executable procedures. This approach bears some similarity to the code-behind way used in Microsoft's .NET 3.0 to access code in XAML, which was released in 2008.</p>

        <h3><a href="/language/unlambda/">Unlambda</a></h3><p>Unlambda is a minimal, "nearly pure" functional programming language invented by David Madore. It is based on combinatory logic, a version of the lambda calculus that omits the lambda operator. It relies mainly on two built-in functions and an apply operator.

        <h3><a href="/language/whitespace/">Whitespace esoteric programming language</a></h3><p>Whitespace is an esoteric programming language developed by Edwin Brady and Chris Morris at the University of Durham. It was released on 1 April 2003. Its name is a reference to whitespace characters. Unlike most programming languages, which ignore or assign little meaning to most whitespace characters, the Whitespace interpreter ignores any non-whitespace characters. Only spaces, tabs and linefeeds have meaning. A consequence of this property is that a Whitespace program can easily be contained within the whitespace characters of a program written in another language, except possibly in languages which depend on spaces for syntax validity such as Python, making the text a polyglot.</p>

        <h3><a href="/language/krl/">KRL</a></h3><p>KRL is a knowledge representation language, developed by Daniel G. Bobrow and Terry Winograd while at Xerox PARC and Stanford University, respectively. It is a frame-based language.
KRL was an attempt to produce a language which was nice to read and write for the engineers who had to write programs in it, processed like human memory, so you could have realistic AI programs, had an underlying semantics which was firmly grounded like logic languages, all in one, all in one language. And I think it - again, in hindsight - it just bogged down under the weight of trying to satisfy all those things at once.

        <h3><a href="/language/a-0-system/">A-0 System programming language</a></h3><p>The A-0 system, written by Grace Murray Hopper in 1951 and 1952 for the UNIVAC I, was an early compiler related tool developed for electronic computers. The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.</p>

Around 1996, Nelson rewrote Inform from first principles to create version 6 .
Over the following decade, version 6 became reasonably stable and a popular language for writing interactive fiction. In 2006, Nelson released Inform 7, a completely new language based on principles of natural language and a new set of tools based around a book-publishing metaphor.</p>

        <h3><a href="/language/java/">Java object-oriented programming language</a></h3><p>Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its original features from SmallTalk, with a syntax similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.</p>

        <h3><a href="/language/angularjs/">AngularJS open source web application framework</a></h3><p>AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web application framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. The JavaScript components complement Apache Cordova, a framework used for developing cross-platform mobile apps. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications. In 2014, the original AngularJS team began working on the Angular application platform.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/s/">S programming language</a></h3><p>S is a statistical programming language developed primarily by John Chambers and Rick Becker and Allan Wilks of Bell Laboratories. The aim of the language, as expressed by John Chambers, is "to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully".</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/factor/">Factor programming language</a></h3><p>Factor is a stack-oriented programming language created by Slava Pestov. Factor is dynamically typed and has automatic memory management, as well as powerful metaprogramming features. The language has a single implementation featuring a self-hosted optimizing compiler and an interactive development environment. The Factor distribution includes a large standard library.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/extensible-application-markup-language/">Extensible Application Markup Language programming language</a></h3><p>Extensible Application Markup Language is a declarative XML-based language developed by Microsoft that is used for initializing structured values and objects. It is available under Microsoft's Open Specification Promise. The acronym originally stood for Extensible Avalon Markup Language, Avalon being the code-name for Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/emacs-lisp/">Emacs Lisp dialect of Lisp used in GNU Emacs</a></h3><p>Emacs Lisp is a dialect of the Lisp programming language used as a scripting language by Emacs. It is used for implementing most of the editing functionality built into Emacs, the remainder being written in C, as is the Lisp interpreter. Emacs Lisp is also termed Elisp, although there is also an older, unrelated Lisp dialect with that name.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/metapost/">MetaPost programming language</a></h3><p>MetaPost refers to both a programming language and the interpreter of the MetaPost programming language. Both are derived from Donald Knuth's Metafont language and interpreter. MetaPost produces vector graphic diagrams from a geometric/algebraic description. The language shares Metafont's declarative syntax for manipulating lines, curves, points and geometric transformations. However,Metafont is set up to produce fonts, in the form of image files with associated font metric files, whereas MetaPost produces EPS, SVG, or PNG files
The output of Metafont consists of the fonts at a fixed resolution in a raster-based format, whereas MetaPost's output is vector-based graphics 
Metafont output is monochrome, whereas MetaPost uses RGB or CMYK colors.
The MetaPost language can include text labels on the diagrams, either strings from a specified font, or anything else that can be typeset with TeX.
Starting with version 1.8, Metapost allows floating-point arithmetic with 64 bits </p>
        <h3><a href="/language/stos-basic/">STOS BASIC dialect of the BASIC programming language</a></h3><p>STOS BASIC is a dialect of the BASIC programming language implemented on the Atari ST computer.
