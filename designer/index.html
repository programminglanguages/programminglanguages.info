        <h3><a href="/language/hal-s/">HAL/S programming language</a></h3><p>HAL/S is a real-time aerospace programming language compiler and cross-compiler for avionics applications used by NASA and associated agencies. It has been used in many U.S. space projects since 1973 and its most significant use was in the Space Shuttle program. It was designed by Intermetrics in 1972 for NASA and delivered in 1973. HAL/S is written in XPL, a dialect of PL/I. Although HAL/S is designed primarily for programming on-board computers, it is general enough to meet nearly all the needs in the production, verification, and support of aerospace and other real-time applications. According to documentation from 2005, it is been maintained by the HAL/S project of United Space Alliance.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/mexscript/">MexScript</a></h3><p>MexScript is a multi-paradigm computer scripting language used in a number of game resource archive file handlers. It was originally created for the 16-bit command-line tool multiex, and later 32-bit versions of MultiEx Commander. It is a script that enables the end user to have the interpreting program perform a number of tasks needed to access file contents, as well as to replace file contents. The MexScript has since become one of the standards to process game archives, as is indicated by the implementation of the script in similar programs, such as Dragon UNpack, Game Extractor, FusePAK, and the more recent dialect QuickBMS.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/lisp/">Lisp programming language</a></h3><p>Lisp is a family of computer programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation.
Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today. Only Fortran is older, by one year.

        <h3><a href="/language/java/">Java object-oriented programming language</a></h3><p>Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its original features from SmallTalk, with a syntax similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.</p>
