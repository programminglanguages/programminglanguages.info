        <h3><a href="/language/ats/">ATS Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>ATS  is a programming language designed to unify programming with formal specification. ATS has support for combining theorem proving with practical programming through the use of advanced type systems. A past version of The Computer Language Benchmarks Game has demonstrated that the performance of ATS is comparable to that of the C and C++ programming languages. By using theorem proving and strict type checking, the compiler can detect and prove that its implemented functions are not susceptible to bugs such as division by zero, memory leaks, buffer overflow, and other forms of memory corruption by verifying pointer arithmetic and reference counting before the program compiles. Additionally, by using the integrated theorem-proving system of ATS (ATS/LF), the programmer may make use of static constructs that are intertwined with the operative code to prove that a function attains its specification.</p>

        <h3><a href="/language/agentsheets/">AgentSheets Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>AgentSheets was the first modern block-based programming language for kids. The idea of AgentSheets was to overcome syntactic challenges found in common text-based programming languages by using drag and drop mechanisms conceptualizing commands such as conditions and actions as editable blocks that could be composed into programs. AgentSheets is used to create media-rich projects such as games and interactive simulations. The main building blocks of AgentSheets are agents which are interactive objects programmed through rules. Using conditions agents can sense the user input including mouse, keyboard and in some versions even speech recognition and web page content. Using actions agents can move, produce sounds, open web pages, and compute formulae.</p>

        <h3><a href="/language/metapost/">MetaPost Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>MetaPost refers to both a programming language and the interpreter of the MetaPost programming language. Both are derived from Donald Knuth's Metafont language and interpreter. MetaPost produces vector graphic diagrams from a geometric/algebraic description. The language shares Metafont's declarative syntax for manipulating lines, curves, points and geometric transformations. However,Metafont is set up to produce fonts, in the form of image files with associated font metric files, whereas MetaPost produces EPS, SVG, or PNG files
The output of Metafont consists of the fonts at a fixed resolution in a raster-based format, whereas MetaPost's output is vector-based graphics 
Metafont output is monochrome, whereas MetaPost uses RGB or CMYK colors.
The MetaPost language can include text labels on the diagrams, either strings from a specified font, or anything else that can be typeset with TeX.
Starting with version 1.8, Metapost allows floating-point arithmetic with 64 bits </p>
