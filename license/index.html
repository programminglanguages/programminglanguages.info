Written by Dave Visti of 80/20 Software, it achieved brief popularity in the 1990s as one of the few BASIC compilers legally available for download from BBSes. However, ASIC understood only a small subset of the BASIC language, with most versions having little or no support for logical operators, control structures, and floating-point arithmetic. These shortcomings are the reason for the software's tongue-in-cheek motto, "ASIC: It's almost BASIC!"</p>

A past version of The Computer Language Benchmarks Game has demonstrated that the performance of ATS is comparable to that of the C and C++ programming languages. By using theorem proving and strict type checking, the compiler can detect and prove that its implemented functions are not susceptible to bugs such as division by zero, memory leaks, buffer overflow, and other forms of memory corruption by verifying pointer arithmetic and reference counting before the program compiles. Additionally, by using the integrated theorem-proving system of ATS (ATS/LF), the programmer may make use of static constructs that are intertwined with the operative code to prove that a function attains its specification.</p>

SWAF elements support Touch events with all the given elements. The user can easily customize the theme for any application by modifying the specific CSS file. For creating an element using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript the user needs to have more knowledge in front-end web development and need to write more lines of code, but in SWAF we can accomplish the same with very few lines of code. As a result, a user can easily develop mobile web application for different platforms with few lines of code.</p>

        <h3><a href="/language/metapost/">MetaPost Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>MetaPost refers to both a programming language and the interpreter of the MetaPost programming language. Both are derived from Donald Knuth's Metafont language and interpreter. MetaPost produces vector graphic diagrams from a geometric/algebraic description. The language shares Metafont's declarative syntax for manipulating lines, curves, points and geometric transformations. However,Metafont is set up to produce fonts, in the form of image files with associated font metric files, whereas MetaPost produces EPS, SVG, or PNG files
The output of Metafont consists of the fonts at a fixed resolution in a raster-based format, whereas MetaPost's output is vector-based graphics 
Metafont output is monochrome, whereas MetaPost uses RGB or CMYK colors.
The MetaPost language can include text labels on the diagrams, either strings from a specified font, or anything else that can be typeset with TeX.
Starting with version 1.8, Metapost allows floating-point arithmetic with 64 bits </p>
