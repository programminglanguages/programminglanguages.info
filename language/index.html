        <h3><a href="/language/flow/">FLOW Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>FLOW is an educational programming language designed by Jef Raskin and Jonathan (Jon) Collins, an undergraduate student in the UCSD Art Department, in 1970 and implemented on several minicomputers in the early 1970s. The goal of the language is to make it easy to explore algorithms through a highly interactive environment. The overall language is very similar in syntax and structure to the BASIC programming language, but has a number of changes in order to make typing code easier. Most notable among these was the concept of "typing amplification", in which short strings, often a single character, were expanded by the language into the complete "unamplified" source code. Modern integrated development environments and code-oriented text editors often include a similar feature, now normally referred to as autocomplete. The beginning programmer would first create a flow chart to solve the problem. Since the all of problems involved words the solution was intuitive. The flow chart would be translated into the flow programming language using a top-down, mechanical method.</p>

Compared to its predecessors, Oberon and Oberon-2, Active Oberon adds objects, system-guarded assertions, preemptive priority scheduling and a changed syntax for methods. Objects may be active, which means that they may be threads or processes. The operating system A2 aka Bluebottle, especially the kernel, synchronizes and coordinates different active objects.</p>

ML provides pattern matching for function arguments, garbage collection, imperative programming, call-by-value and currying. It is used heavily in programming language research and is one of the few languages to be completely specified and verified using formal semantics. Its types and pattern matching make it well-suited and commonly used to operate on other formal languages, such as in compiler writing, automated theorem proving, and formal verification.</p>

YASS is largely built upon making the language easy to read and use, with optional support for syntaxes such as curly-bracket syntax. YASS supports dynamic typing. It was started in 2015 as a planned university project but later was changed to be a replacement for another programming language developing at the time known as BlackRabbit Script, also built by Jamie Balfour. ZPE and YASS were designed to help with the automation of scripts by clearing up the inconsistent syntaxes of other scripting languages. The Zenith Parsing Engine powers the underlying parsers including the CSV, JSON and XML parsers.</p>

It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</p>

This also avoids the overhead associated with runtime intermediate representations, such as virtual DOM, unlike traditional frameworks which carry out the bulk of their work at runtime, i.e in the browser.
The compiler itself is written in TypeScript. Its source code is licensed under MIT License and hosted on GitHub.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/elm/">Elm Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>Elm is a domain-specific programming language for declaratively creating web browser-based graphical user interfaces. Elm is purely functional, and is developed with emphasis on usability, performance, and robustness. It advertises "no runtime exceptions in practice", made possible by the Elm compiler's static type checking.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/d/">D Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>D, also known as dlang, is a multi-paradigm system programming language created by Walter Bright at Digital Mars and released in 2001. Andrei Alexandrescu joined the design and development effort in 2007. Though it originated as a re-engineering of C++, D is a profoundly different language —features of D can be considered streamlined and expanded-upon ideas from C++, however D also draws inspiration from other high-level programming languages, notably Java, Python, Ruby, C#, and Eiffel.</p>

These alone make it Turing-complete, but there are also some input/output (I/O) functions to enable interacting with the user, some shortcut functions, and a lazy evaluation function. Variables are unsupported.</p>

It was specifically designed to be almost impossible to use, via a counter-intuitive 'crazy operation', base-three arithmetic, and self-altering code. It builds on the difficulty of earlier challenging esoteric languages, but takes this aspect to the extreme, playing on the entangled histories of computer science and encryption. Despite this design, it is possible to write useful Malbolge programs.</p>

The A-0 functioned more as a loader or linker than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and its arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into machine code that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.</p>

The term has been used by different technical writers to emphasize different aspects of front-end web development. For some writers, the term has been understood more generally to refer to separation of functionality from a web page's structure/content and presentation, while other writers have used the term more precisely to refer to the use of progressive enhancement to support user agents that lack certain JavaScript functionality and users that have disabled JavaScript. Following the latter definition, unobtrusive JavaScript contributes to web accessibility insofar as it helps ensure that all users—whatever their computing platform—get roughly equal access to all of the web page's information and functionality.</p>

Rust emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. Rust enforces memory safety—that is, that all references point to valid memory—without requiring the use of a garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent concurrent data races, Rust's borrow checker tracks the object lifetime and variable scope of all references in a program during compilation. Rust is popular for systems programming but also offers high-level features including functional programming constructs.</p>

Swift works with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift's design was the ability to interoperate with the huge body of existing Objective-C code developed for Apple products over the previous decades. It was built with the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014. On Apple platforms, it uses the Objective-C runtime library, which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.</p>

ATS has support for combining theorem proving with practical programming through the use of advanced type systems. A past version of The Computer Language Benchmarks Game has demonstrated that the performance of ATS is comparable to that of the C and C++ programming languages. By using theorem proving and strict type checking, the compiler can detect and prove that its implemented functions are not susceptible to bugs such as division by zero, memory leaks, buffer overflow, and other forms of memory corruption by verifying pointer arithmetic and reference counting before the program compiles. Additionally, by using the integrated theorem-proving system of ATS (ATS/LF), the programmer may make use of static constructs that are intertwined with the operative code to prove that a function attains its specification.</p>

        <h3><a href="/language/whitespace/">Whitespace Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>Whitespace is an esoteric programming language developed by Edwin Brady and Chris Morris at the University of Durham. It was released on 1 April 2003. Its name is a reference to whitespace characters. Unlike most programming languages, which ignore or assign little meaning to most whitespace characters, the Whitespace interpreter ignores any non-whitespace characters. Only spaces, tabs and linefeeds have meaning. A consequence of this property is that a Whitespace program can easily be contained within the whitespace characters of a program written in another language, except possibly in languages which depend on spaces for syntax validity such as Python, making the text a polyglot.</p>
