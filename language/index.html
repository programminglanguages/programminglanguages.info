        <h3><a href="/language/blitz-basic/">Blitz BASIC Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>Blitz BASIC refers to the programming language dialect that was interpreted by the first Blitz compilers, devised by New Zealand-based developer Mark Sibly. Being derived from BASIC, Blitz syntax was designed to be easy to pick up for beginners first learning to program. The languages are game-programming oriented but are often found general-purpose enough to be used for most types of application. The Blitz language evolved as new products were released, with recent incarnations offering support for more advanced programming techniques such as object-orientation and multi-threading. This led to the languages losing their BASIC moniker in later years.</p>

It was so-called because it was about 80% of PL/I. Written in PL/I and bootstrapped via the PL/I Optimizing compiler, it was an alternative to PL/S for system programming, compiling initially to an intermediate machine-independent language with symbolic registers and machine-like operations. It applied machine-independent program optimization techniques to this intermediate language to produce exceptionally good object code. The intermediate language was mapped by the back-end to the target machine's register architecture and instruction set. Back-ends were written for IBM 801, S/370, Motorola 68000, and POWER/PowerPC. A version was used on IBM mainframes as a development tool for software that was being designed for the AS/400, as well as to write the "i370" internal code for the "Capitol" chipset used in some ES/9370 models and the millicode for S/390 and z/Architecture processors.</p>

        <h3><a href="/language/deterministic-parallel-java/">Deterministic Parallel Java Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>Deterministic Parallel Java (DPJ) is an extension of the Java programming language which adds parallel constructs that provide a deterministic programming model for object-oriented languages. The language extensions define a type system that a programmer can use to annotate Java code with type information, and a compiler can use to type-check that a DPJ program has deterministic semantics, i.e., produces the same visible output for a given input, in all executions. Parallel algorithms that cannot be expressed entirely in the statically checked type system require run-time mechanisms to enforce determinism: two key research goals are to make the type system more expressive and to minimize the need to fall back to run-time techniques. With minor modifications, language extensions should be applicable to other base OO languages, such as C++ and C#.</p>

AHDL has an Ada-like syntax and its feature set is comparable to the synthesizable portions of the Verilog and VHDL hardware description languages. In contrast to HDLs such as Verilog and VHDL, AHDL is a design-entry language only; all of its language constructs are synthesizable. By default, Altera software expects AHDL source files to have a .tdf extension.</p>

It is known for its use of the polymorphic Hindley–Milner type system, which automatically assigns the types of most expressions without requiring explicit type annotations, and ensures type safety – there is a formal proof that a well-typed ML program does not cause runtime type errors. ML provides pattern matching for function arguments, garbage collection, imperative programming, call-by-value and currying. It is used heavily in programming language research and is one of the few languages to be completely specified and verified using formal semantics. Its types and pattern matching make it well-suited and commonly used to operate on other formal languages, such as in compiler writing, automated theorem proving, and formal verification.</p>

The interpreter is written in Modula-3, and provides Obliq with full access to Modula-3's network objects capabilities. A type inference algorithm for record concatenation, subtyping and recursive types has been developed for Obliq, more important it has been proved to be NP-complete 
and its lowest complexity to be Ο(n3) or if under other modeling up to certain conditions down to Ο(n2) and its best known implementation runs in Ο(n5).
Obliq's syntax is very similar to Modula-3, the biggest difference being that Obliq has no need of explicit typed variables although explicit type declarations are allowed and ignored by the interpreter. The basic data types in the language include booleans, integers, reals, characters, strings, and arrays. Obliq supports the usual set of sequential control structures, as well as special control forms for concurrency. Besides that Obliq's objects are able to be cloned and safely copied remotely by any machine in a distributed network object and it can be done in a transparent way.</p>

        <h3><a href="/language/charm++/">Charm++ Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>Charm++ is a parallel object-oriented programming language based on C++ and developed in the Parallel Programming Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Charm++ is designed with the goal of enhancing programmer productivity by providing a high-level abstraction of a parallel program while at the same time delivering good performance on a wide variety of underlying hardware platforms. Programs written in Charm++ are decomposed into a number of cooperating message-driven objects called chares. When a programmer invokes a method on an object, the Charm++ runtime system sends a message to the invoked object, which may reside on the local processor or on a remote processor in a parallel computation. This message triggers the execution of code within the chare to handle the message asynchronously.</p>
