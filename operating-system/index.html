However unlike Smalltalk, Citrine lacks the concept of a class. In this regard, Citrine is more like Self and JavaScript because it uses prototypes. The combination of Smalltalk like messages and prototypes is what makes Citrine unique.</p>

        <h3><a href="/language/4dos/">4DOS Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>4DOS is a command line interpreter by JP Software, designed to replace the default command interpreter COMMAND.COM in DOS and Windows 95/98/SE/ME. 4OS2 and 4NT replace CMD.EXE in OS/2 and Windows NT respectively. 4DOS was written by Rex C. Conn and Tom Rawson; it was first released in 1989. These programs can also be initiated from the command line and/or called by scripts.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/turbo-c++/">Turbo C++ Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>Turbo C++ is a discontinued C++ compiler and integrated development environment and computer language originally from Borland. Most recently it was distributed by Embarcadero Technologies, which acquired all of Borland's compiler tools with the purchase of its CodeGear division in 2008. The original Turbo C++ product line was put on hold after 1994 and was revived in 2006 as an introductory-level IDE, essentially a stripped-down version of their flagship C++Builder. Turbo C++ 2006 was released on September 5, 2006 and was available in 'Explorer' and 'Professional' editions. The Explorer edition was free to download and distribute while the Professional edition was a commercial product. In October 2009 Embarcadero Technologies discontinued support of its 2006 C++ editions. As such, the Explorer edition is no longer available for download and the Professional edition is no longer available for purchase from Embarcadero Technologies. Turbo C++ is succeeded by C++Builder.</p>

        <h3><a href="/language/sequencel/">SequenceL Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>SequenceL is a general purpose functional programming language and auto-parallelizing compiler and tool set, whose primary design objectives are performance on multi-core processor hardware, ease of programming, platform portability/optimization, and code clarity and readability. Its main advantage is that it can be used to write straightforward code that automatically takes full advantage of all the processing power available, without programmers needing to be concerned with identifying parallelisms, specifying vectorization, avoiding race conditions, and other challenges of manual directive-based programming approaches such as OpenMP.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/applescript/">AppleScript Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>AppleScript is a scripting language created by Apple Inc. that facilitates automated control over scriptable Mac applications. First introduced in System 7, it is currently included in all versions of macOS as part of a package of system automation tools. The term "AppleScript" may refer to the language itself, to an individual script written in the language, or, informally, to the macOS Open Scripting Architecture that underlies the language.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/digital-command-language/">DIGITAL Command Language Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>DIGITAL Command Language (DCL) is the standard command language

adopted by most of the operating systems (OSs) that were sold by the former Digital Equipment Corporation. DCL had its roots in the IAS, TOPS-20, and RT-11 OSs and was implemented as a standard across most of Digital's OSs, notably RSX-11, but took its most powerful form in the OpenVMS OS.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/ampl/">AMPL Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>A Mathematical Programming Language (AMPL) is an algebraic modeling language to describe and solve high-complexity problems for large-scale mathematical computing .
It was developed by Robert Fourer, David Gay, and Brian Kernighan at Bell Laboratories.
AMPL supports dozens of solvers, both open source and commercial software, including CBC, CPLEX, FortMP, Gurobi, MINOS, IPOPT, SNOPT, KNITRO, and LGO. Problems are passed to solvers as nl files.
AMPL is used by more than 100 corporate clients, and by government agencies and academic institutions.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/simulink/">Simulink Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>Simulink, developed by MathWorks, is a graphical programming environment for modeling, simulating and analyzing multidomain dynamical systems. Its primary interface is a graphical block diagramming tool and a customizable set of block libraries. It offers tight integration with the rest of the MATLAB environment and can either drive MATLAB or be scripted from it. Simulink is widely used in automatic control and digital signal processing for multidomain simulation and model-based design.</p>

        <h3><a href="/language/high-level-assembly/">High Level Assembly Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>High Level Assembly (HLA) is a high-level assembly language developed by Randall Hyde. It allows the use of higher-level language constructs to aid both beginners and advanced assembly developers. It fully supports advanced data types and object-oriented programming. It uses a syntax loosely based on several high-level programming languages (HLLs), such as Pascal, Ada, Modula-2, and C++, to allow creating readable assembly language programs, and to allow HLL programmers to learn HLA as fast as possible.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/zebra/">Zebra Programming Language Information & Resources</a></h3><p>Zebra Programming Language is a page description language from Zebra Technologies. It is used primarily for labeling applications. The original ZPL was advanced to ZPL II, but a full compatibility with the older version is not given. Meanwhile, ZPL II is emulated by many label printers of various producers.</p>
