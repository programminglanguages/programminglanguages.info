It is built with the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014. On Apple platforms, it uses the Objective-C runtime library which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/perl/">Perl interpreted programming language</a></h3><p>Perl is a family of two high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages, Perl 5 and Perl 6.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/arc/">Arc dialect of the Lisp programming language.</a></h3><p>Arc is a programming language, a dialect of the language Lisp, developed by Paul Graham and Robert Morris. It is free and open-source software released under the Artistic License 2.0.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/autohotkey/">AutoHotkey free, open-source macro-creation and automation software for Windows</a></h3><p>AutoHotkey is a free, open-source custom scripting language for Microsoft Windows, initially aimed at providing easy keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys, fast macro-creation and software automation that allows users of most levels of computer skill to automate repetitive tasks in any Windows application. User interfaces can easily be extended or modified by AutoHotkey. The AutoHotkey installation includes its own extensive help file, and web-based documentation is also available.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/elixir/">Elixir Programming language</a></h3><p>Elixir is a functional, concurrent, general-purpose programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). Elixir builds on top of Erlang and shares the same abstractions for building distributed, fault-tolerant applications. Elixir also provides a productive tooling and an extensible design. The latter is supported by compile-time metaprogramming with macros and polymorphism via protocols.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/php/">PHP server-side scripting language</a></h3><p>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor is a server-side scripting language designed for Web development. It was originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994; the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/dartmouth-basic/">Dartmouth BASIC programming language</a></h3><p>Dartmouth BASIC is the original version of the BASIC programming language. It was designed by two professors at Dartmouth College, John Kemény and Thomas Kurtz. It was developed as part of the Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS) and was one of the first programming languages intended to be used interactively.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/cobol/">COBOL object-oriented programming language</a></h3><p>COBOL is a compiled English-like computer programming language designed for business use. It is imperative, procedural and, since 2002, object-oriented. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments. COBOL is still widely used in legacy applications deployed on mainframe computers, such as large-scale batch and transaction processing jobs. But due to its declining popularity and the retirement of experienced COBOL programmers, programs are being migrated to new platforms, rewritten in modern languages or replaced with software packages. Most programming in COBOL is now purely to maintain existing applications.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/typescript/">TypeScript programming language, superset of JavaScript that compiles to JavaScript</a></h3><p>TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/web/">WEB programming language</a></h3><p>WEB is a computer programming system created by Donald E. Knuth as the first implementation of what he called "literate programming": the idea that one could create software as works of literature, by embedding source code inside descriptive text, rather than the reverse, in an order that is convenient for exposition to human readers, rather than in the order demanded by the compiler.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/processing/">Processing programming language</a></h3><p>Processing is an open-source graphical library and integrated development environment (IDE) / playground built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching non-programmers the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/planner/">Planner programming language</a></h3><p>Planner is a programming language designed by Carl Hewitt at MIT, and first published in 1969. First, subsets such as Micro-Planner and Pico-Planner were implemented, and then essentially the whole language was implemented as Popler by Julian Davies at the University of Edinburgh in the POP-2 programming language. Derivations such as QA4, Conniver, QLISP and Ether were important tools in Artificial Intelligence research in the 1970s, which influenced commercial developments such as KEE and ART.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/root/">ROOT data analysis software</a></h3><p>ROOT is an object-oriented program and library developed by CERN. It was originally designed for particle physics data analysis and contains several features specific to this field, but it is also used in other applications such as astronomy and data mining. The latest release is 6.14.06, as of 2018-11-14.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/fact/">FACT programming language</a></h3><p>FACT is an early discontinued computer programming language, created by the Datamatic Division of Minneapolis Honeywell for its model 800 series business computers in 1959. FACT was an acronym for "Fully Automated Compiling Technique". It was an influence on the design of the COBOL programming language.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/c♯/">C# multi-paradigm (object-oriented) programming language</a></h3><p>C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO. C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/blub/">Blub Disambiguation page providing links to topics that could be referred to by the same search term</a></h3><p>Blub may refer to:Blub, an abandoned water park in Berlin
A hypothetical programming language imagined by programmer Paul Graham
5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole synthase, an enzyme
An informal term for crying</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/blockly/">Blockly Blockly visual programming language</a></h3><p>Blockly is a client-side JavaScript library for creating visual block programming languages and editors. It is a project of Google and is open-source under the Apache 2.0 License. It typically runs in a web browser, and visually resembles Scratch. Blockly is also being implemented for Android and iOS; not all web browser based features are available for Android/iOS.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/high-level-assembly/">High Level Assembly</a></h3><p>High Level Assembly (HLA) is a high-level assembly language developed by Randall Hyde. It allows the use of higher-level language constructs to aid both beginners and advanced assembly developers. It fully supports advanced data types and object-oriented programming. It uses a syntax loosely based on several high-level programming languages (HLLs), such as Pascal, Ada, Modula-2, and C++, to allow creating readable assembly language programs, and to allow HLL programmers to learn HLA as fast as possible.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/ocaml/">OCaml implementation of the Caml programming language</a></h3><p>OCaml is the main implementation of the Caml programming language created by Xavier Leroy, Jérôme Vouillon, Damien Doligez, Didier Rémy, Ascánder Suárez, and others in 1996. A member of the ML family, OCaml extends Caml with object-oriented features.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/r/">R programming language for statistical computing</a></h3><p>R is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. Polls, data mining surveys, and studies of scholarly literature databases show substantial increases in popularity in recent years. As of January 2019, R ranks 12th in the TIOBE index, a measure of popularity of programming languages.</p>
        <h3><a href="/language/oberon-2/">Oberon-2 programming language</a></h3><p>Oberon-2 is an extension of the original Oberon programming language that adds limited reflection and object-oriented programming facilities, open arrays as pointer base types, read-only field export and reintroduces the FOR loop from Modula-2.</p>
